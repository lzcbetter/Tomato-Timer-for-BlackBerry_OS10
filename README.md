## Tomato Timer for BlackBerry OS 10(especially for blackberry passport)
The Pomodoro (Tomato) Technique can help you power through distractions, hyper-focus, and get things done in short bursts, while taking frequent breaks to come up for air and relax. Best of all, it's easy. If you have a busy job where you're expected to produce, it's a great way to get through your tasks. This application is originally designed on BlackBerry Native SDK with notification dialogue, **sound** and customizable __LED__ notification. You just set and focus on your work, when time is up, you will get notification from your BlackBerry.
